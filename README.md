## THOMAS EROMOSE IKIMI

I am an aspiring junior developer transitioning from a full time career in the motion picture industry. I am seeking opportunities in software development and design: Ideally I would be working with inventive, creative people with whom I can collaborate and offer my expertise in project development and innovative problem solving.

## Skills

#### This Skill

Having spent over 15 years in film and tv as a writer, director, producer and (grudging) editor, I have had to build a robust skillset spanning many different disciplines. Project inception, development, team building and oversight, as well as delivery to tight deadlines and budget management. I believe my abilities are well suited to the world of software and technology as coding is just another tool of the creative mind. It's not the tools, but the craftsman that matters most. Coding to me is art.
